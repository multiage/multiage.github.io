## What you will do on the day of participation
<br>
If you decide to take part, we will schedule an appointment with you, choosing a time and location that work best for you. On the day, two people from our research team (Farah and Zlati) will meet you. They will explain each of the tasks to you and answer any questions you might have. They will also bring the study laptop. You will not have to interact with the laptop yourself, we will do that for you. We use the laptop to show you the tasks and record your responses. In most tasks, we will show you some pictures of common objects and daily life situations. We will ask you to name verbally the objects or describe the situations that you see on the pictures, in the languages you speak. We will audio record your responses. You will also do a few small interview-like additional tasks, where you’d have to answer simple questions (for example, what type of books you like to read) or tell stories. Finally, we will ask you to complete a questionnaire about how you learned your languages and how you have been using them throughout your life. At the very end, we will compensate you with the £25 Amazon voucher and some gifts to thank you for your participation.
