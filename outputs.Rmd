## Public talks
<div align="justify">
**November 2025**: We were invited to Small Heath's Neighbourhood Planning event, Birmingham. We spoke about the importance of multilingualism in our community and neighbourhood, and how multilingual people's cognitive and language abilities may change with age. We specifically addressed the importance of including multilinguals' voices in the better scientific understanding of ageing and dementia. </div>

<div align="justify">
**November 2025**: We gave a talk at Hamara Centre's men's group, Sheffield. We discussed the meaning of multilingualism, the status of South Asian languages in the UK, and how our brain changes - including its language abilities - when we age. </div>
&nbsp;

<div align="justify">
**October 2025**: We gave a talk at Hamara Centre's women’s group, Sheffield. Here we discussed the nature of multilingualism in the context of South Asian languages, how languages change across generations, as well as language and ageing more broadly. </div>

<div align="justify">
**May 2025**: Dr Zlati Ilchovska presented a general-public talk on bilingual brains' potential, as part of the multinational multi-city "Pint of Science" festival, York, UK. She talked about the value of bilingualism and the benefits it can offer to us, while also debunking a few popular myths about bilingualism! </div>

## Media
<div align="justify">
**September 2025**: Dr Farah Nazir and Dr Angela de Bruin were invited as guests at Fever FM Radio to discuss the way language changes with ageing and why there is little research on how this affects bilingual speakers, especially of minority languages like Pahari-Pothwari/Mirpuri and/or Panjabi. They also discussed topics such as which language we think and feel in and how that changes from a generation to another within a diaspora.

## Conference presentations and posters
<div align="justify">
**November 2025**: Dr Angela de Bruin will be presenting a research talk at the Psychonomic Society meeting, in Denver (USA). She will be presenting research looking at the benefits of code switching, specifically how multilinguals might use code switches to let the listener know that unexpected information is coming up. </div>

**Late September 2025**: Dr Zlati Ilchovska presented online a research talk at the Brazilian Seminar of Language and Cognition, organised by the State University of Campinas. She spoke on the topic of control during language switching. Additionally, she presented the structure of the MultiAge project, some preliminary findings of its first study, and talked about the role of the switching context, in which bilinguals practice their two languages daily.

**Early September 2025**: Dr Zlati Ilchovska presented a research poster with preliminary findings at the very large conference of the European Society for Cognitive Psychology (ESCoP), held at the University of Sheffield. The poster enjoyed a lot of attention and sparked the interest of a variety of researchers in bilingualism, multilingualism, ageing and minority languages! </div>

**June 2025**: Dr Angela de Bruin presented a research poster on a preliminary study looking at how multilingual language choice is influenced by the language choices of your conversation partner. This poster was presented at one of the largest conferences on multilingualism worldwide - the International Symposium on Bilingualism, in Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain. </div>

**November 2024**: Dr Angela de Bruin presented a talk on a research project looking at the way multilinguals’ language production is influenced by short exposure to other multilinguals. This talk was given at one of the largest conferences on experimental psychology worldwide (Psychonomic Society), in New York City (USA). </div>
